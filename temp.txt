Fleet footwork lets you stay in lane for multiple fights and get an early gold advantage
When you "Q" somebody , position yourself away from the minions so that the missiles focus the champion.
Prioritize leveling up "W" second for more burst potential thanks to your passive stacks.
"W" will always hit the last place where your cursor was when you pressed it, no matter if you flash or ult before it is launched.
